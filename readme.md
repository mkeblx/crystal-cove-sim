a simulator of optical positional tracking, modeled after the oculus crystal cove prototype

## todo

* write up description and goals
* load CC prototype model with LEDs
* IR camera view: what camera would see
* dynamically adjustable IR camera paramaters: FoV, resolution, framerate
* tracking using IR camera frame data
* comparision of IR tracking to known input
* micro-graphs of tracking data over time
* 3/4 view to show camera frustum
