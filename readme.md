# crystal cove simulator

a simulator of optical positional tracking, modeled after the oculus crystal cove prototype

## todo

* oculus mode: track QR-code like markers attached to Rift
* implement tracking from 'IR camera' source
* statistical comparision of IR tracking to cam input
* demo app using positional tracking

## thanks

* a big thanks to [Chris Nelson](http://crunchymetal.carbonmade.com) for the awesome Crystal Cove prototype model
* [headtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr/) library for doing the heavy lifting for head tracking
